					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
                    <p>My passion lies in programming and web development, with proficiency in languages such as C/C++, Java and Python and experience with technologies like HTML/CSS, NodeJS, Angular, 
                        and ReactJS. I have been an active member of the chapter IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, leading projects that integrate advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. 
                        Additionally, I have competed in the E-Yantra competition hosted by IIT Bombay, where my team and I successfully simulated a Luminosity Drone using ROS and Gazebo simulation. I am deeply interested in
                         exploring innovative solutions in technology, continuously seeking opportunities to learn and apply my skills in real-world scenarios.</p>

					<h2>WORK/PROJECT EXPERIENCE</h2>
					<!-- your work experience -->
                    <h3>Face Detection using Template Matching</h3>
                    <p>
                        Utilized the TM_CCOEFF_NORMED method for Face Detection, which involves computing the normalized cross-
                        correlation coefficient between the template and the target image patches. This technique evaluates the similarity
                        between the template and different regions of the target image, highlighting areas with high correlation scores as
                        potential matches.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Mind and Body Health Website</h3>
                    <p>
                        Developed the front-end of a comprehensive health website, serving as a unified platform for both mental and physical
                        well-being solutions. Utilized HTML/CSS for layout and design, JavaScript and jQuery for dynamic functionality, and
                        AngularJS for building a robust and scalable web application.
                    </p>
                    <h3>IEEE Robotics and Automation Society</h3>
                    <p>
                        As an active member of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society chapter at VIT, I led the development of the chapterâ€™s
                        website using ReactJS for the front-end framework, JavaScript for interactivity, and HTML/CSS for structuring and
                        styling the content. Additionally, I authored a blog post that leverages Discrete Fourier Transformation and azimuthal
                        averaging to preprocess images, combined with Logistic Regression and SVM classifiers, to effectively distinguish
                        between real and deepfake images
                    </p>
